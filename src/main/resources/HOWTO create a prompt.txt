How to Make ChatGPT Talk the Way You Want: Easy Steps

Why Do This?
ChatGPT can adjust its responses to match your chatting style. While it can remember your preferences during a single chat, it needs a reminder at the start of each new session. This reminder is called a "prompt." This guide will help you create a prompt so ChatGPT can chat just the way you prefer.

1. Start Chatting

Talk to ChatGPT about anything you like. It could be about a book, a movie, or any fun topic.
2. Tell ChatGPT What You Like

If ChatGPT says something you don't prefer, let it know. For example, if you want shorter answers or wish to skip some topics, just say so.
3. Make a List of Your Likes

After chatting for a while, ask ChatGPT to make a list of what you talked about. This helps ChatGPT remember how you like to chat.
4. Use Your List Next Time

The next time you chat, show ChatGPT your list. It'll help guide the conversation the way you like.
Helpful Hints:

Be Clear: The more direct you are about what you like, the better ChatGPT can chat with you.
Try Again: You can make a new list anytime to improve your chats.
Stay Curious: Exploring different topics can make your chats more fun.
Ask Questions: If something's unclear, just ask. ChatGPT is here to help.
The Recursive Step: Using This Tutorial as Your Prompt
After you've had a good chat with ChatGPT:

Paste this entire tutorial at the end of your chat.
Simply ask, "Can you generate a prompt for me based on our chat?"
ChatGPT should then provide you with a personalized prompt, presented as a code block for easy copying.
By doing this, you're giving ChatGPT a comprehensive guide on how you like to chat, and it will generate a perfect prompt tailored just for you!
