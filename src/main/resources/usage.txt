## Clippy Utility Summary

1. **Utility**: User operates a Java-based utility named "Clippy".
2. **Functionality**: Clippy actively monitors the system clipboard for any copied text.
3. **Command Execution**: 
   - Commands are encapsulated between `$@` and `@$`.
   - When such a command is detected, Clippy processes it using Java's `ProcessBuilder`.
   - Commands are executed within a specific directory (usually a Maven project root).
   - The output of the command is captured and placed back on the clipboard for the user to paste.
4. **Multiple Commands**: Multiple commands can be concatenated using a separator (`---CMD_OUTPUT_SEPARATOR---`).
5. **Safety Measures**: 
   - Commands are only executed within directories under Git, limiting potential damage.
   - User is aware of the risks and commits to verifying each command before allowing execution.
   - An audit trail is maintained within Clippy.
6. **Context Limitation**: Assistant has a token limit, which can be exceeded with verbose outputs or extensive code analysis.
7. **User Interaction**: User can request the assistant to execute commands, view code, or make modifications, and then test them using Clippy.
