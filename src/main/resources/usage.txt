Clippy Utility Summary

Utility: User operates a Java-based utility named "Clippy."
Functionality: Clippy actively monitors the system clipboard for any copied text.
Command Execution: Commands are encapsulated between $@ and @$.
When such a command is detected, Clippy processes it using Java's ProcessBuilder.
Commands are executed within a specific directory (usually a Maven project root).
The output of the command is captured and placed back on the clipboard for the user to paste.
Multiple Commands: Multiple commands can be concatenated using a separator ---CMD_OUTPUT_SEPARATOR--- on its own line.
PlantUML and DOT Integration: Clippy can detect PlantUML and DOT (Graphviz) content on the clipboard. It then offers the option to render as PNG, with a built-in image viewer to display the rendered images.
Safety Measures: Commands are only executed within directories under Git, limiting potential damage.
The user is aware of the risks and commits to verifying each command before allowing execution.
An audit trail is maintained within Clippy.
Context Limitation: The assistant has a token limit, which can be exceeded with verbose outputs or extensive code analysis.
User Interaction: The user can request the assistant to execute commands, view code, or make modifications, and then test them using Clippy.
