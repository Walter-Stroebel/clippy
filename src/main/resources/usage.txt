Clippy Utility Summary

Utility: User operates a Java-based utility named "Clippy."

Functionality: Clippy actively monitors the system clipboard for any copied text.

Command Execution: Commands are encapsulated between $@ and @$.
Multiple Commands: Multiple commands can be concatenated using a separator ---CMD_OUTPUT_SEPARATOR--- on its own line.
The output of the command is captured and placed back on the clipboard for the user to paste.
When such a command is detected, Clippy processes it using Java's ProcessBuilder.

Safety Measures: Commands are only executed within a specific directory under Git, limiting potential damage.
The user is aware of the risks and commits to verifying each command before allowing execution.
An audit trail is maintained within Clippy.

PlantUML and DOT Integration: Clippy can detect PlantUML, DOT (Graphviz) and SVG content on the clipboard. It then offers the option to render as PNG, with a built-in image viewer to display the rendered images.
