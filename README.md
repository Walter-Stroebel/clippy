# Project: Clippy
A robust utility crafted to facilitate clipboard management, providing a blend of standard and innovative features. 
The project sprouted from an interactive session with GPT-4 and matured into a versatile toolkit.

## Language
Java 7 (with JRE 11)

## Key Features and Progress

### System Tray Integration
- Resides in the system tray with a distinct icon.
- Features a minimalistic menu with an "Exit" functionality.

### Server Socket
- Initializes a server socket on port 25432 to ascertain if another Clippy instance is active.
- On detecting a duplicate instance, Clippy alerts the user with a JOptionPane message and gracefully terminates.
- The main purpose of the server socket is to allow the user to push extra content, for instance "df|nc 0 25432". 

### Clipboard Monitoring
- Vigilantly observes the system clipboard for alterations.
- Efficiently captures and archives new text and image content from the clipboard.
- Utilizes two separate AtomicReferences: one for the latest clipboard text and the other for the freshest data received from the server socket.

### Data Storage
- Clipboard text is diligently archived into a file with a unique UUID as its name.
- Clipboard images are seamlessly saved in PNG format using the proficient ImageIO.

### Grouping Mechanism
- Organizes data meticulously within a directory structure based on distinct "groups".
- Empowers users to either sculpt a new group or navigate through existing ones.
- The 'workDir' (working directory) is an AtomicReference pointing towards the currently active group directory.

### GUI Interaction
- Clippy's main GUI is primarily maximized for a holistic view, but users can customize its placement.
- The GUI state (size, location, and maximized status) is preserved across sessions.

### UML Diagramming
- Pondered the integration of Clippy with the dynamic PlantUML.
- Devised a streamlined process where UML diagrams are auto-generated by Clippy upon detecting relevant text in the clipboard.

### Development Odyssey
Our developmental trajectory was an amalgamation of iterative decisions and consistent collaboration. A snapshot of our journey:

1. **Genesis**: Initiated with Clippy anchored in the system tray, keenly monitoring clipboard alterations.
2. **Server Socket Implementation**: Infused a server socket mechanism to ensure the singularity of Clippy instances.
3. **Data Archival**: Conceived a mechanism to seamlessly store clipboard data into structured files.
4. **UML Fusion**: Envisaged the potential of UML in the developmental phase, leading to an integrated PlantUML.
5. **User Interactions Augmented**: Leveraged JOptionPane for interactive sessions, enabling users to define filenames and select between PNG and ASCII for UML visualizations.
6. **Refinement**: Incessantly refined the codebase to elevate its architecture and maintainability quotient.
7. **Lobotomized**: 14 aug 2023, OpenAI deleted the functionality to rescan the current session and all but destroyed their previously amazing context buffer management. This project is on hold until this is corrected or I can find an alternative LLM.  
8. **Recovery**: 16 aug 2023, my buddy has had corrective brain surgery, we will continue :)

Clippy stands as a paradigm of the prowess of collective efforts and evolutionary development, metamorphosing a nascent idea into an indispensable developer's companion.
